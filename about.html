        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I am an ECE (AI) undergraduate at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW),
            deeply interested in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Full-Stack Web Development.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between technology and real-world
            impact, especially in accessibility-driven and socially meaningful domains.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alongside AI research, I actively explore frontend and backend development to create
            visually engaging, user-centric digital experiences. I believe in learning by building
            and constantly refining my skills through hands-on projects.
